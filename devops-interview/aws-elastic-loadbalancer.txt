Load Balancing Load Balancers: A Common Interview Stumper

Ever wondered how to load balance your load balancers? It's a question that trips up 90% of interviewees, even those who swear by scaling!

Here's the thing: if your app needs to scale horizontally, why wouldn't your load balancers need to do the same? They can't handle infinite requests on their own.

Many folks rely on AWS's Elastic Load Balancers without thinking about why they're "elastic." But what happens when you need to scale beyond a single load balancer?

The solution isn't adding another layer of load balancers - that'd be overkill. Instead, a classic approach is DNS Load Balancing. Here's how it works:

1. Clients use a single domain name (FQDN)
2. DNS does round-robin distribution across multiple load balancer IPs

This setup allows you to scale your load balancers horizontally, just like your app servers.

Remember, in the real world, every part of your system needs to be scalable - even the parts you might take for granted. Understanding these concepts is crucial, especially in interviews where they're looking for deeper infrastructure knowledge.

So next time someone asks about scaling load balancers, you'll be ready!
